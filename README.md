# Advent of Code 2025
Rust solutions to https://adventofcode.com/2025/. There is a create for each day's puzzles (`day1`, `day2`, etc.), and you can run each one with:
```bash
cargo run -- <puzzle_num> <filename>
```
Where `<puzzle_num>` is either `1` or `2` and `filename` is a path to the puzzle input.
